# Swing React

See Evernote with the same name.

An experiment in creating a React like library in Clojure for Clojure, Java, and Swing.

The goal is to make something that can be used in Java and with legacy applications and have it be completely
Functional Reactive Programming.

I'm starting with a pure Clojure implementation and no Java bindings because that's easiest.
